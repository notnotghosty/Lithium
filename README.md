2. Configuration: Edit the source code (Program.cs) to specify the applications you want to launch and the DLLs you want to inject into their processes. Modify the Main method to define the executable paths, launch arguments, target process names, and DLL names as needed.
3. Build: Build the Lithium Launcher project using your preferred C# compiler.
4. Run: Execute the compiled Lithium Launcher executable (LithiumLauncher.exe) to automatically launch the specified applications and inject the designated DLLs into their processes upon startup.
## Features
- Executable Launching: Launch target applications with custom arguments or parameters directly from the code.
- DLL Injection: Inject DLLs into the memory space of running processes for enhanced functionality.
- Automated Injection: Automatically inject DLLs into target processes as soon as they start, ensuring seamless integration without user intervention.
